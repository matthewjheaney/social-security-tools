     <h1>About the Social Security Calculator</h1>
     <p>
       This site is designed to give individuals a clear idea of what their
       Social Security retirement benefits might be. It uses data provided
       by the Social Security website
       (<a href="https://ssa.gov">https://ssa.gov/</a>) for an earning's
       record. From that data, the site produces a detailed social security
       report.
     </p>
     <h3>What If?</h3>
     <p>
       This site provides clear interactive visuals that let the user
       investigate how different choices might affect their overall benefit.
       Scenarios include:
       <ul>
         <li>
           What happens to my benefit if I earn additional wages for several
           more years?
         </li>
         <li>
           How does my benefit change as my total earnings grow during my
           lifetime?
         </li>
         <li>
           What happens if I choose to take my benefits early? What if I delay
           and take them late?
         </li>
       </ul>
     </p>
     <h3>Security</h3>
     <p>
       This site does not store any data entered by users. All calculations are
       made client-side in the browser's JavaScript and are never transmitted
       over the internet.
     </p>
     <p>
       While unnecessary for security, this can be confirmed by loading the
       site in your browser, and then disconnecting your computer before
       entering any additional data.
     </p>
     <h3>Accuracy</h3>
     <p>
       This site should be correct, and I will update it as social security
       rules change. However, there are no <i>guarantees</i> of the accuracy of
       this information. It should be treated as a useful exploratory tool, but
       any decisions should be made after researching the subject yourself.
     </p>
     <h3>Why?</h3>
     <p>
       This site is completely free and contains no advertising. I don't
       collect your email address, subscribe you to SMS services, make a credit
       report inquiry, kill a dolphin, etc. Feel free to use the site without
       wondering if there is a catch.
     </p>
     <p>
       Costs for running the site are minimal, just a few dollars a year, plus
       my time.
     </p>
     <p>
       I noticed that most people don't understand their Social Security
       benefits very well. The online tools at SSA.gov are excellent, but
       I felt lacking in a few places. In particular, I felt that by simply
       spitting out a final number, the results failed to educate the user as
       to how the program works. I thought it would be useful to contribute a
       tool that helped folks to understand their own social security benefit
       and how it will help them in the future. Consider it an act of goodwill
       for a good cause.
